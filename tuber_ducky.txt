So I have to print out the number
	what are the best ways to do it?
		1. collect the specifayers and attachtm to a struct and then have a print function.
		2. just print everytihng as it comes, so I see a minuss print it 15 times do it in a procedural way
			
		what the probelm with structs
			1. alocating memory
			2. freeing it
			3. nothing really I guess besides that

		whats the problem oing it with varibles
			1. function sapce, in therory I can pass it around from function to function and then its not going to be a worry
			2. 

		going with structs:
			1. I need to have function for checing the string and then initiaazing the values.
			2. I need to pass the struct to print functions
			3. I need to iterait and acces varibles from the struct easaly


			!!!		EDGE CASES		!!!
				I can have a function which will check if the conversion_specifayer is valid and alose print specific out puts if needed!
